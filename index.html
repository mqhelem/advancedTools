                If you have done your ‚Äúdownward dog‚Äù yoga pose today, you are
                probably feeling more relaxed. Regardless of your level of yoga
                expertise, if you are practicing regularly, you can feel better
                from head to toe. Yoga offers physical and mental health
                benefits for people of all ages. And, if you are going through
                an illness, recovering from surgery or living with a chronic
                condition, yoga can become an integral part of your treatment
                and potentially hasten healing. A yoga therapist can work with
                patients and put together individualized plans that work
                together with their medical and surgical therapies. That way,
                yoga can support the healing process and help the person
                experience symptoms with more centeredness and less distress.
                Research shows that a consistent bedtime yoga routine can help
                you get in the right mindset.

              <p class="card-text">
                Weather App is the application of science and technology to
                predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location
                and time. People have attempted to predict the weather
                informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century.
                Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about
                the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using
                meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given
                place. It is very important to get educated on the current
                weather situation of a particular location as preferred since it
                affects the day to day life of everyone. It is more effective if
                we can get quickly updated on current weather status of a
                required location, as it makes it easy to handle not only our
                activities, but also our livelihoods too.A huge problem that we
                are facing nowadays is inability to know real weather status in
                such places.

              <p class="card-text">
                Greek yogurt is a thick, creamy yogurt that can add flavor and
                texture to foods. Other benefits of Greek yogurt include
                boosting bone health, building muscle mass, and lowering the
                risk of certain health conditions. Greek yogurt differs from
                other yogurts because it goes through a straining process to
                remove the whey. Whey is a liquid that contains lactose, a
                natural sugar found in milk. Making yogurt involves fermenting
                milk with live cultures of beneficial bacteria. Strained Greek
                yogurt is lower in sugar than regular yogurt. Removing the whey
                produces a thicker, creamier yogurt with a tart taste.Some
                manufacturers add thickening agents to regular yogurt, and
                market it as ‚ÄúGreek-style‚Äù yogurt, which may not share the same
                health benefits as Greek yogurt.
